## âœ¨ About me 

I started programming at the age of 9 using tools like RPG Maker VX Ace and Game Maker Studio. But when I really started to grow as a game developer when I found the **best** game engine: Construct 2. It has been a while from those times and I've learned a lot more on the way-

* I mainly code with PHP, Javascript and C#. But I know how to code on **Python** and **Java** but I'm always open to new languages.
* I like using Javascript but PHP is my bet for **Backend** (sorry nodejs).
* I really like **CSS** and vanilla **frontend**.
* I try to make semantic **HTML** and accesible and SEO friendly websites.
* I'm a game developer who uses Construct 2 and more recently **Unity 3D**. But I've used **Godot** in the past.
* You know, I'm something of a ~~scientist~~ designer. I know how to use very well **Photoshop** and **Premier**, and I learned to have a very trained eye.
* I like the very geek side of technology: cybersecurity, Torrent, Blockchain, etc. Although I'm not capable of working with those same technologies (_some day..._).
* I like the creative side of programming aswell that its cold hard logic side so I would like to specialize in Rust or C++
