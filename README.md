I started programming at the age of 9 years old, using tools like RPG Maker VX Ace and Game Maker Studio. 

In this **10+ years** journey, I was able to experiment with a lot of tech, and was able to grow as a **Full-Stack developer**.

* I'm specialized in web technologies, developing cross-platform apps mostly with modern **JavaScript** & **PHP**.
* I'm **always coding**. I can switch between languages, different code styles and tooling with ease.
* I'm a game developer and designer, who uses **Construct 3** and **Unity 3D**.
* I'm a huge promoter of **Open-Source**. The majority of my tech-stack is based around **FLOSS** and ethical technologies.
* I like to teach. I've done **conferences** and **tutored** and  trained developers, students and newbies in the field.

Currently I'm working as the **Tech Lead** of [Weblabor Mx](https://github.com/weblabormx), developing multiple projects and helping engineers across all our codebases.
