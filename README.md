## ðŸ’» About me

I started programming at the age of 9 using tools like RPG Maker VX Ace and Game Maker Studio. But when I really started to grow as a game developer when I found the **best** game engine: Construct 2. It has been a while from those times and I've learned a lot more on the way-

* I mainly code with PHP, Javascript and C#. But I know how to code on **Python** and **Java** but I'm always open to new languages.
* I really like **CSS** and vanilla **frontend**.
* I'm a game developer who uses Construct 2 and more recently **Unity 3D**. But I've used **Godot** in the past.
* I like the creative side of programming aswell that its cold hard logic side I'm into cybersecurity and would like to learn Rust or C++-
